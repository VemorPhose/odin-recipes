    <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>
        1/2 teaspoon garlic powder (optional for added flavor)      </li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano (optional for added flavor)</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3><strong>Instructions:</strong></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare a Baking Sheet: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create Cheese Piles: Place small heaps (about 1 tablespoon each) of grated Parmesan cheese on the prepared baking sheet. Make sure to space them about 2 inches apart.
      </li>
      <li>
        Optional Seasoning: If desired, sprinkle a pinch of garlic powder and dried oregano over each cheese pile. This step adds extra flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake: Put the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for about 5-7 minutes or until the cheese piles melt and turn golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cool and Crisp: Remove the cheese crisps from the oven and let them cool for a minute or two on the baking sheet. As they cool, they will become crisp.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve: Once they have cooled and crisped up, carefully lift the Parmesan cheese crisps from the baking sheet using a spatula.
      </li>
